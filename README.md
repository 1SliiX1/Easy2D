# Easy2D
Lua "sudo game engine"


---- quick rundown ----

The goal with this "sudo game engine" is to expand on the
extremely good "love2d" with a plethora of tools and an
entity component system to go along with that. The goal with
these tools is to make them as simple to use as possible and
turn what originally took ours to make into a one liner.


---- notes ----

If you go into the component folder you will see a folder
named "Scence" and a folder named "Comp" inside of these
folders are a python script, dont worry about that im
changing that soon, it was a really bad design idea.
